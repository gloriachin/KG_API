    "### Summary of Current API\n",
    "\n",
    "As of right now, the API only handles direct-relationship queries. For example, \"What are the drugs approved to treat the disease Acute Myeloid Leukemia?\" is a question that the current API can handle because drug and disease nodes share a common, direct, relationship (edge) between them in the graph database. This pattern is the same for gene-to-gene and drug-to-gene queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Future Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Future steps include creating additional endpoints that would handle indirect-relationship queries, those that require multiple hops. For example, \"What are the gene targets of the disease Acute Myeloid Leukemia?\" is a question that we hope to be able to handle in the future. Gene and disease nodes do not share a direct relationship (edge) between them, so this query requires an additional step to find that middle connection, in this case a drug node. So, future goals include writing endpoints to handle such cases."
